## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from France, currently based in Paris.

Passionate about blockchain, trading, and backend development with Node.js and TypeScript. I love solving complex problems. Looking to join a dynamic team where I can innovate, collaborate, and grow.

When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me exploring nature, sailing the seas 🌊, or hiking in the mountains ⛰️, always chasing new adventures and pushing my limits.
