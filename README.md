## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from France 🇫🇷, currently based in Paris 🌍. Passionate about Node.js, TypeScript, blockchain, and trading, I thrive on building robust and scalable software 💻. When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me exploring nature 🌳, sailing the sea 🌊, or hiking in the mountains ⛰️, always chasing new adventures and pushing my limits.
