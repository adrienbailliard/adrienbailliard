## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from France, currently based in Paris.

Passionate about blockchain, trading, and clean architecture. I turn complex problems into efficient solutions using Node.js and TypeScript. Always learning, always building.

When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me exploring nature, sailing the seas 🌊, or hiking in the mountains ⛰️, always chasing new adventures and pushing my limits.
